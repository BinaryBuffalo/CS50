notes >
    I noticed that Python can be really sensitive when it comes
    to spacing & small things can mess the whole application up,
    It took some getting used to as I am very use too using alot of
    tabs in C developement.

    Django has alot of differances & constant updates something
    That is made months agow may not work on a newer version.

    I think some more python training would make this alot more easy 
    but that will have to wait as im only on page 20 in my python 
    crashcourse book.
